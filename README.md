# Surgical-Mortality-Prediction

## Introduction
This project was completed in collaboration with University of Southern Florida Surgical Department. We used patient history, charlson score, ICD9 Procedure Codes to build a machine learning model that can predict the risk mortality of a patient giving doctors and nurses a warning for patients who need more attention due to the sugrical procedures they underwent. The procedures we focused on only cardiac surgical procedures.
